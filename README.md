# PyD3

## What is PyD3?

PyD3 is an Implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm, used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.

## How to Access

To run PyD3, clone the repository to the desired directory and set it as your working directory. under src/, run PyD3.py 
`python PyD3.py <path_to_table>`. The table you provide must be in the format of:

attribute1, attribute2, attribute3, ..., classifier \\
data1, data2, data3, ..., classifier_n \\
datax, datay, dataz, ..., classifier_m \\
...
