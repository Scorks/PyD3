# PyD3

## What is PyD3?

PyD3 is an Implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm, used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.

## How to Access

Anyone can access the PyD3 UI located [here](http://www.pyd3online.com "PyD3"). This UI uses [Treant.js](https://github.com/fperucic/treant-js "Treant.js") communicating with ouput from Python scripts.

Or, if you'd prefer to interpret the source code, you can run PyD3.py with specified arguments within the terminal.
